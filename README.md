# Java-past-mistakes

- Be careful when declaring variables inside conditionals, especially when the variables are use in later operations outside the conditionals.
- Constructors have no return type.
- PrintWriter no output? Close it!
- Enter the full path name, otherwise it'll say file does not exist.

## Char and String
- Do not use == to compare objects as it would compare references to objects, not the value of the objects.
- When adding characters together, the value of char are added and thus an int would be returned. To concat, declare a string and add each char to the string.
- char cannot be dereferenced: character is a primitive type and not an object, so it cannot be derefferenced.
  Ex. Character.toUpperCase(str.charAt(0)); 
  Alt. str.substring(0,1).toUpperCase();
- StringBuilder: create new object, call methods on instance, and convert toString()

## Error handling
- <Java: Identifier expected> declare variable outside of try block.
- <error: class, interface, or enum expected> typically occurs when there is an additional curly brace at the end of the program.
- IllegalStateException: thrown when method invoked inappropriately.
- NoSuchElementException: pass value to next() before using hasNext() to check if there are more tokens. thrown by scanner
- Required: Variable Found: Value   switched the operands in assign statement; trying to assign a new value to a value is not possible

## Arrays related
- OUT OF BOUND: make sure the sequence of conditions inside a for loop are taken into consideration, such as condition that checks null for an object should be put before || if the second condition involves the same object in not null conditions.
- In 2d arrays, arrayName.length refers to # of rows, and arrayName.length[0] refers to # of columns in row 0.
- Out of bound: notice that i++ has updated the status of i (since using i outside of the loop, i needs to be initialized outside the loop).
- ArrayList can efficiently access elements at any valid index but inserts are expensive, whereas a LinkedList supports efficient inserts but access requires iterating through elements. So a program that will do many accesses and few inserts might use an ArrayList.
- Enhanced for loop: iterate through ArrayList.
- In method definition, 'â€¦' represents an array

## Interacting classes
- Unified Modeling Language (UML): 0..* --> zero or more instances; 1..1 --> exactly one instance.
- In a class's method that attempts to modify another class's object, use conditions to check if the object is null; if null then nothing can be modified.
